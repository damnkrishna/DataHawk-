# Python Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up your Python environment using the installation script.

## How to Use

Follow these simple steps to install and configure your Python environment:

### 1. Save the Script

Create the installation script file:

```bash
nano install_python_env.sh
```

Paste the script content, then:
- Save: `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`
- Exit: `Ctrl + X`

### 2. Make it Executable

Grant execution permissions to the script:

```bash
chmod +x install_python_env.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the installation script:

```bash
./install_python_env.sh
```

## What This Script Does

The installation script will:
- Set up your Python environment
- Install necessary dependencies
- Configure the virtual environment
- Prepare your system for development

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied**: Ensure you've made the script executable with `chmod +x`
- **Command not found**: Verify the script is in your current directory
- **Installation errors**: Check that you have sufficient permissions and internet connectivity

## Next Steps

After successful installation, your Python environment will be ready for use. You can now proceed with your project setup or additional tool installations.
